have it more detailed

add context,




Standalone batch __> standalonepipieline with is_atomic flag
the blue clasees with inherit these, with is_atomic flag
write that they are going to be  deprecated in 2.
we recomment standalone pipeline and cluster pipeline with is atomic 


**figure out whats going to be deprecated in v2


defauult is_tmoic for transaction is true
for pipeline default false, put example where there is error and show u get results

alias and  mention transaction is deprecated
open issue and pr to rename json to json_pipeline, for all 3 languages. ping to yipin
same for vss



TODO

you have a small pr to rename the modules from transaction to pipeline,
you have the doc explaining the discussion's maskanot. 
you are stuck with the lambda, you are trying to figure out what permissions are needed but you are stuck with trying to confugre something witht the dns.
hope you had a ton of fun and :)
missed you!
you had some time to relax, now its time to push hard!! <3


djs:
last thing was we added "Service": "djs.aws.internal" to the principal in the trust policy





in tests, take transaction test function,
all nodes, all primaries, multinode
EX ping to all primaries
mset to multislot keys works
check which command go to all nodes and test oit  -- configs




write in the message:
we had a customer issue bla bla complaning about performance.. using no tls and waiting between requests and standalone cluster.. we checked the performance and saw its true..
the benchmarks check the performance of tls and cluster mode without sleep, so its kind of "misookh". i created a quip of the results to compare the performances 





Hi bro! You have the python pipeline impel comitted. check if theres anything else to change like names and you are clear to PR!
Hope you had fun and good rest, and you are back with good energies! <3<3
You need to complete the rest of the pipeline wrappers, learn how to add the roles to the bi cdk, and work on the region build.
Love you and good luck :)
